## 2. Reddit Post Examples (More Detail, Community-Focused)

**Focus:** Detailed explanations, challenges, lessons learned, seeking specific technical advice, fostering discussion. Choose relevant subreddits (e.g., r/running, r/MachineLearning, r/indiehackers, r/buildapc, r/webdev).

### Example 1: Launch Announcement / Major Feature (r/running, r/MachineLearning)
**Title:** "We're building an AI Running Coach on WhatsApp ‚Äì and we're doing it in public! (Update: Intelligent Onboarding & Vector Memory)"

**Body:**
"Hey everyone,

We're the team behind Andes, an AI-powered running coach delivered right through WhatsApp. Our mission is to make personalized, data-driven coaching accessible to everyone. We've been building in public, sharing our journey, and today we wanted to give you an update on some major progress.

**What's New:**

1.  **Intelligent Onboarding:** We've revamped our onboarding process. Instead of a rigid questionnaire, our AI now guides you conversationally, remembers your previous answers, and even supports multiple languages (English & Spanish initially). This makes getting started much smoother.
    *   *Technical detail:* We implemented a `current_onboarding_question` field in our user profiles and integrated an `I18nService` to handle dynamic prompts.

2.  **Vector Memory Integration:** This is a big one for personalization! We've integrated Qdrant (a vector database) to give Andes a 'semantic memory.' This means it can understand the *meaning* of your past conversations and runs, leading to much more relevant advice.
    *   *How it works:* When you log a run or ask a question, we create a vector embedding of that interaction. Later, when you ask for advice, Andes searches its memory for semantically similar past events or insights.
    *   *Impact:* Our `PerformanceAnalystAgent` now gives more insightful feedback, and the `TrainingPlannerAgent` creates plans that truly adapt to your unique history, including injuries and preferences.

3.  **Natural Language Run Logging:** You can now simply tell Andes about your run (e.g., "Just ran 10k in 55 minutes, felt tired") and it will extract the data, log it, and store it in your profile.

4.  **Automated Progress Cards:** We've set up a weekly cron job that generates a visual summary of your progress (distance, pace, VDOT, insights) and sends it directly to you on WhatsApp.

**Why "Building in Public"?**
We believe in transparency and getting early feedback. We're sharing our tech stack (Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, DeepSeek AI), our challenges, and our wins. We want to build this *with* the running community.

**What's Next:**
Our focus is now on refining the AI's conversational abilities, improving plan adaptation, and preparing for beta testing.

We'd love to hear your thoughts! What do you look for in a running coach? Any questions about our tech?

### Example 2: Technical Challenge / Lesson Learned (r/webdev, r/Nodejs, r/PostgreSQL)
**Title:** "Optimizing AI Agent Orchestration: Lessons from building a WhatsApp Bot"

**Body:**
"Hey fellow developers,

We're working on Andes, an AI running coach, and wanted to share a challenge we faced with our multi-agent architecture and how we're tackling it.

**The Problem:**
Our `HeadCoach` orchestrates several specialized AI agents (Onboarding, Planner, Analyst, etc.). Initially, we had a simple LLM prompt for agent selection. However, as the system grew, the LLM sometimes struggled to pick the *most* relevant agent or provide enough context for the chosen agent. This led to less personalized responses.

**Our Solution: Context-Aware Agent Selection with Vector Memory**
We realized the `HeadCoach` needed more context than just the current message and chat history. We've now integrated our `VectorMemory` (powered by Qdrant) directly into the agent selection prompt.

*   **How it works:** Before the `HeadCoach` decides which agent to activate, it retrieves semantically relevant past memories (e.g., previous injury reports, long-term goals, past performance analyses) related to the user's current message. This 'semantic context' is then injected into the LLM's prompt for agent selection.
*   **Impact:** The LLM now has a richer understanding of the user's long-term needs and history, leading to more accurate agent routing and, consequently, more relevant and personalized responses from the specialized agents.

**Example:** If a user says "My knee hurts after that long run," the `HeadCoach` can now retrieve past injury history from `VectorMemory` *before* activating the `NutritionRecoveryAgent`, allowing the agent to provide more tailored advice.

**Lessons Learned:**
*   Explicitly providing relevant context to the LLM, even for internal decision-making (like agent selection), significantly improves performance.
*   Vector databases are powerful for adding 'long-term memory' to conversational AI, going beyond simple chat history.

Has anyone else faced similar challenges with multi-agent systems or context management in LLM applications? We'd love to hear your approaches!
