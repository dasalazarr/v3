#### **Hybrid AI Architecture Launch**
```
🤖 MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Just launched our Hybrid AI architecture! 

Instead of using one expensive AI for everything, we built an intelligent routing system:

✅ DeepSeek-V3 for data logging & simple tasks (75% cost reduction)
✅ GPT-4o Mini for complex coaching & emotional support  
✅ Smart routing based on message complexity

Result: 75% cost savings while IMPROVING user experience 🚀

```

#### **Onboarding System Success**
```
🎯 PROBLEM SOLVED: Users were skipping our onboarding flow

Our solution:
✅ Mandatory completion for ALL users (no exceptions)
✅ Expert-designed prompts with examples
✅ Function calling to prevent incomplete data
✅ One question at a time for better UX

Result: 100% onboarding completion rate! 

Sometimes the best feature is the one users can't skip 😅

#### **Technical Debt Cleanup**
```
🧹 SPRING CLEANING: Just removed 20+ obsolete files from our codebase

What we eliminated:
❌ Legacy template system
❌ Unused configuration files  
❌ Temporary debug scripts
❌ Scattered documentation

Result: 30-50% faster builds & much cleaner architecture

Sometimes the best code is the code you delete 🗑️

#### **AI Model Routing Strategy**
```
🧠 TECHNICAL DEEP-DIVE: How we route between AI models

Our Intent Classifier analyzes each message:

"today i ran 6.4 km in 34 minutes" 
→ DeepSeek (structured data extraction)

"I'm feeling discouraged about my progress"
→ GPT-4o Mini (emotional support)

"Can you create a marathon training plan?"
→ GPT-4o Mini (complex reasoning)

Smart routing = Right tool for right job 🎯

#### **Database Schema Evolution**
```
📊 DATABASE EVOLUTION: How we handle user onboarding data

Before: Basic boolean "onboarding_completed"
After: Granular field tracking with validation

✅ Name, age, experience level (required)
✅ Weekly frequency, main goal (required)  
✅ Injury history (optional)
✅ Real-time completion status checking

Better data = Better coaching 🏃‍♂️
