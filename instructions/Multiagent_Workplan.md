# Multi-Agent Integration Work Plan

This document outlines the phased approach to evolve the running coach bot into an intelligent multi-agent system. The plan preserves existing WhatsApp integration and services while adding new capabilities for planning, specialized task execution and persistent memory.

## Phase 1 – Multi-Agent Foundation (Weeks 1–2)
1. **Create new `multi-agent` package**
   - Set up basic scaffolding for agent registry and communication.
2. **Migrate configuration**
   - Reuse current environment variables.
   - Add settings for specialized agents.
3. **Implement Planner Agent**
   - Handles task decomposition and coordinates other agents.

## Phase 2 – Advanced Memory (Weeks 3–4)
1. Enhance vector memory package with semantic search.
2. Introduce structured memory layer alongside existing chat buffer.
3. Integrate both layers to provide contextual retrieval.

## Phase 3 – Specialized Agents (Weeks 5–6)
1. Training Agent for workout plans.
2. Progress Agent for analytics.
3. Injury Prevention Agent for monitoring pain signals.

## Phase 4 – Intelligent Orchestrator (Weeks 7–8)
1. Add workflow manager for sequencing tasks.
2. Register specialized tools for data access and plan generation.

## Phase 5 – Integration & Migration (Weeks 9–10)
1. Extend API gateway endpoints for multi-agent system.
2. Maintain backward compatibility with existing endpoints.
3. Use feature flags for gradual rollout.

## Phase 6 – Optimization & Resilience (Weeks 11–12)
1. Introduce reflection agent for self-correction.
2. Implement monitoring and automated alerts.

This roadmap ensures a gradual migration to a robust multi-agent architecture while maintaining all current functionality.
